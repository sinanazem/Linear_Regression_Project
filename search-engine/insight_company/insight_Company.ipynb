      "title: Fragile—handle with care, \n",
      "content: Updated April 29, 2022\n",
      "Investors with bond-centric portfolios are likely feeling fragile after unusually poor first-quarter returns. Here are a few tips for handling them with care.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first-quarter 2022 market downturn squeezed equity and fixed income asset classes alike. This less common market event of both negative stock and bond returns likely affected all investors, but its impact may have gained special notice from conservative, bond-centric investors because they also have the highest loss aversion.\n",
      "You might find it beneficial to reach out proactively to your most conservatively invested clients, as they may be less accustomed to simultaneous stock and bond drawdowns of the magnitude we just witnessed.\n",
      "As their advisor, you've spent a great deal of time building a strong relationship with your clients to gain their trust and develop a thoughtful financial plan. One unfavorable quarter should not trigger a change to that plan if it was appropriate going into the year. Educating your clients on the frequency and magnitude of these types of events—and keeping their long-term objectives in focus—can help them maintain perspective and stay committed to their plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps you remember as a kid trying to play the piano, throw a ball, or some other activity that required more developed motor skills. If so, you likely also remember how one side or muscle became much stronger and more adept than the other. Similarly, as an investment behavioral coach, you've possibly grown quite proficient in helping your more aggressively allocated, equity-centric clients \"stay the course\" in equity bear markets.\n",
      "But like a right-footed soccer player who has the chance to score the winning goal—with his left foot—advisors are now being confronted with the need to conduct unfamiliar conversations with their most conservatively invested, bond-centric clients.\n",
      "That's because, generally speaking, bonds have experienced a 40-year bull market—there's seldom been bad news to communicate, but the first quarter of 2022 delivered some of history's worst bond returns, in addition to negative stock returns. This year's first-quarter drawdown of –5.9% ranks as the third-worst quarter for bonds in the last 50 years.1 As a result, for the first time in a long time, you will likely need to place greater emphasis on coaching your more conservatively invested clients.\n",
      "These more loss-averse investors may feel an elevated state of anxiety and unease—and will need to be approached with care and empathy. Following, we provide some context on how this unusual quarter shaped up, along with a few pointers to help guide your conversations with clients.\n",
      "Buckle up—conservative investors likely to find the quarter unsettling\n",
      "Typically, the greatest pain in a portfolio comes to those investors more heavily weighted toward equities and other risky assets. However, in the first quarter of 2022 both stocks and bonds had negative returns—so, conservative investors have experienced a drawdown that is much less common for them. In fact, bond returns for the quarter were worse than stocks. In the past 50 years, an investor with a 30/70 stock/bond mix has only experienced three worse quarters.1\n",
      "This differs markedly from the experience of a more aggressive 70/30 investor.  They've experienced similar or worse quarterly performance 23 times, or, on average, every two to three years. Said a different way, the conservative 30/70 investor just experienced a return of –5.7% that would rank near the bottom percentile over the last 50 years.1  To put that in context, the same percentile loss for a more aggressive 70/30 investor would be a much larger –13.0%;2  instead, the first quarter of 2022 saw the 70/30 investor \"only\" experience a –5.5% drawdown (see chart below).\n",
      "For your conservatively invested clients, it's a matter of helping them put things into perspective. Historically speaking—yes, bonds saw one of their worst quarters. But comparatively speaking, when equities are in a bear market, they tend to fare much worse. Also, you can point out that this type of performance from bonds has, so far, proven exceedingly rare.\n",
      "A tale of two return profiles—mostly bonds versus mostly stocks\n",
      "Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\n",
      "Notes: The 30% stock/70% bond and 70% stock/30% bond portfolios comprise the Spliced US Bond and Spliced US Equity return series, weighted according to their respective stock and bond allocations. Bond portion of portfolios is composed of Spliced US Bonds, as represented by IA SBBI U.S. Intermediate-Term Government Bond Index from April 1 to December 31, 1972; Bloomberg U.S. Government/Credit Intermediate-Term Index from January 1, 1973, to December 31, 1975; and Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index thereafter. Stock portion of portfolios is composed of Spliced US Equity as represented by the FT Willshire 5000 Index from April 1, 1972, to June 30, 1994; MSCI USA Investable Market Index from July 1, 1994, to June 30, 2001; and CRSP US Total Market Index thereafter.\n",
      "Sources: Vanguard analysis of Morningstar Direct data, as of March 31, 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bond yields have risen in the past two years\n",
      "As shown below, during 2020, the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were as low as 0.12% and 0.62% respectively, and at the end of the first quarter sat at 2.28% and 2.32%, respectively.  Most of history has shown that remaining committed to one’s investment plan is likely a much better alternative to additional de-risking (such as moving further into bonds or money markets). This especially applies in real purchasing power terms. So, in addition to managing drawdown risk from the markets, the advisor and client should together balance and manage purchasing power risk—that is, the risk the investment portfolio does not keep up with inflation over a long time horizon.\n",

      "As we know, when the financial markets are volatile, investors can feel strongly compelled to change their financial plan and their stated portfolio asset allocations to stem any perceived continued losses. Yet, it is often the case that staying the course is the better path in the long term. Often this doesn't mean standing still, but taking the action of rebalancing into the underperforming asset class. It's most often best to stick to the long-term plan that you and your client have built together, with changes being made because of changes in their goals, objectives, risk appetite, and other aspects of their life, not because of changes in the markets.\n",
      "Getting the message across\n",
      "For some clients, the dynamics contributing to 2022's disappointing first-quarter performance will seem evident and understandable. For others, especially those who viewed fixed income investments as drama-free safe havens, their quarterly statements may come as a shock.\n",
      "We recommend taking a proactive approach and reaching out to clients, if possible, before they call you. Here we offer a few guiding principles to help you structure your conversations:\n",
      "\n",
      "Communicate from a place of empathy. Putting yourself in their shoes, you understand that investing in bonds has historically provided their capital with shelter from much of the volatility more common to riskier equities. You have an opportunity to put this atypical bond-market event into context for them—before conversations with their friends and family or reading news headlines prompts them to question their long-term investing plan.\n",
      "Take care to avoid promissory statements. While your goal is to provide comfort and understanding, you also want to give clients a realistic picture about the future. And the truth is, none of us knows for certain what the future holds for the markets (thus, you'd do well to avoid statements such as, \"No need to worry, because the bond market has bottomed\"). You can think of every interaction with your clients as the opportunity to build or lose trust, credibility, and authenticity; it's like a bank where you are depositing or withdrawing trust. Candor is a net contributor to your trust balance with clients.\n",
      "Focus on the relationship between long-term risk and return premiums. Historically, stocks have provided higher returns than bonds or cash but have carried a higher degree of risk. If investors were not compensated for the additional risk they took over longer time periods, no one would buy the higher-risk assets. Such market pressure pushes down the price of these assets to a level where risk is eventually adequately priced into the market. Bonds, in turn, should also over longer periods provide higher returns and carry greater risk than cash. Again, you can remind clients that portfolio asset allocation balances principal risk and purchasing power risk—the risk that their balances lose value to inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proactively sharing how unique the quarter has been, while providing your empathy, care, and counseling, can go a long way toward helping your clients stick to their financial plans and keep their long-term goals on track.\n",

Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\n",
      "Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments.

      "body: factor etfs driving outcomes after a wild year rideour factor etfs recently celebrated their three year anniversary crossing this threshold provided a great opportunity to check in with antonio picca head of vanguard factor based strategies about the current state of our lineup the market environment and strategies to implement factor based investing in your portfolio construction approach vanguard factor etfs recently hit their three year mark now that they have achieved this milestone can you provide some thoughts and insights into the first three years for vanguard s first actively managed etfs it has been a wild ride who could have predicted a pandemic fueled rally happening at the top of the longest bull run in the history of the u s stock market in this environment our factor etfs experienced some of the largest movements ever observed in years of historical data this is partly the result of our design choices when designing the funds we made the deliberate choice of targeting factors across the capitalization spectrum each portfolio is split evenly across large mid and small cap stocks because we believe that gives them the best potential for outperformance over the long term factor premiums can show up at different times and in different parts of the market cap spectrum so it s important to be diversified across the whole spectrum in order to capture the premium when it s there this decision turned out to be a major headwind in the first couple of years with the market driven exclusively by a small group of mega cap growth stocks we were forced to face tough questions such as are factors broken and does your approach make sense in a winner takes all economy there was no simple answer to these tough questions however what kept us optimistic was the observation that similar dynamics happened in the late s and early s coinciding with the second and third longest bull runs in the u s market s history our optimism was finally validated last year when the covid shock changed the market narrative and factors started delivering stronger performance across the capitalization spectrum as you can see from the chart below the early days of our factor products saw a handful of large cap growth stocks driving market performance while the covid shock made this trend even more pronounced we are beginning to see a strong comeback in value and small cap stocks as the country emerges from the pandemic a changing market narrative leads to stronger factor performance across the capitalization spectrum source factset based on data from february through may for standardized performance for vfva click here the performance data shown represent past performance which is not a guarantee of future results investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so investors shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data cited for performance data current to the most recent month end visit our website at vanguard com performance the performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment as you cannot invest directly in an index we ve recently seen a market environment that has been more favorable to small cap and value stocks why are our factor etfs uniquely positioned to take advantage of this current market trend so far value stocks have been the protagonists of the economic recovery their performance really shined once there was positive news about the efficacy of the covid vaccines and a strong economic stimulus this fell perfectly in line with our expectations since value stocks are pro cyclical and tend to do their best during periods of economic recovery the small cap performance reflects the broadening market leadership of stocks that were previously ignored by investors but are getting a second chance this is key when evaluating how our factors may perform going forward the dichotomy between growth and value is so ingrained into the common narrative that most people tend to think that we are going from a lopsided market obsessed with a small group of high flying technology and media companies to one dominated by small cap energy and financial companies as this obsession for growth wanes it creates opportunities for other companies across the capitalization spectrum and across factors all of our factors value quality momentum liquidity multifactor and minimum volatility are well positioned to benefit from this not just our value product even our momentum strategy is positioned to take advantage as our active implementation approach has allowed us to quickly transition from a growth play through most of to a value broader play in early if you don t believe me just look at their valuations despite the recent performance rebound our factors are still trading at historically low valuations compared with the broad equity market this means that there is still the potential to outperform over the next and years value for example would need to outperform the russell index by to get back in line with its average historical valuation relative to the market market factors trading at historically low valuations versus the broad market source refinitiv financial solutions based on data through may methodology relative

index what is your outlook for factor based products going forward despite some challenges for value which is the poster child for factor investing factors have proved that they can deliver strong outcomes for investors and i believe they will continue to do so in the future if you think about where the investment landscape is going with greater focus on technology and customization it is hard to see a future where factors don t play an important role in an investor s portfolio it is easy to lose focus of that long term trend if you follow the markets these days with flashy hedge funds meme stocks and cryptocurrencies capturing all of the headlines but i think that factor based etfs will continue to garner assets from traditional forms of active management and even from broad market investing going forward can you provide some examples of how you ve seen advisors implementing our factor etfs into their portfolio construction approach over the last three years we ve worked with many advisors helping them incorporate factors into their clients portfolios we re still seeing a large dispersion in factor knowledge across the investor spectrum those who are further along their factor journey have generally a strong idea about which factors they wish to target and how they can be used strategically as a large percentage of their allocation intended to be held for a long time horizon or tactically leaning into a factor more aggressively based on its valuation or momentum with perhaps a shorter term horizon our portfolio and analytics team has also worked with investors who aren t as familiar with factors yet want to substitute current active manager allocations with a lower cost factor portfolio many fall somewhere in between these folks generally combine many factors together and use a multifactor approach as the satellite of their allocation check out our factor etf lineup customize clients tilts toward the factors that influence portfolio performance u s value
