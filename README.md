## What is a Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm in machine learning. It models a prediction value according to independent variables and helps in finding the relationship between those variables and the forecast. Regression models depend on the relationship between the independent and dependent variables as well as the number of variables they use.

Linear regression predicts the dependent value (y) according to the independent variable (x). The output here is the dependent value, and the input is the independent value. The hypothesis function for linear regression is the following:

The linear regression model finds the best line, which predicts the value of y according to the provided value of x. To get the best line, it finds the most suitable values for 1 and 2. 1 is the intercept, and 2 is the coefficient of x. When we find the best values for 1 and 2, we find the best line for your linear regression as well.
